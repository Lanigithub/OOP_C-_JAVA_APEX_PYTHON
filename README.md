# OOP: C#, JAVA, APEX, and PYTHON

OOP (object oriented programming: python Java, Apex, C#) is about creating Data and methods(to perform operations on data). 

​The main advantage of oop is OOP provides a clear structure for the program, and keep it dry (don't repeat yourself " , and makes the codes easier to maintain, modify and debug. 
​
​Relationship between a class and objects: class is the Blueprint or template of objects and objects are instances . Example of class  Car has objects of types (make)of cars (Volvo, Audi, Toyota, Tesla) and their attributes or fields ( color, make, model, year ,weight) and methods (or functions: drive and brake.

​constructor: a class is like objects constructor, or a blueprint to create objects.
​a special method is called a constructor that is used to initialize objects. For example model=" Santa Fe" in a method is called a constructor that sets initial value for a field. 
​ Static and public are two access identifiers .

 Methods need to be public for objects to access. Static method can be accessed without creating an object of the class. 

​Creating a object need to specify the class name followed by the object name, and used the keyword new: Car toyota= new Car ();
