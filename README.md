## OOP: C#, JAVA, APEX, and PYTHON

### 1. OOP (object oriented programming: python Java, Apex, C#) is about creating Data and methods to perform operations on data. 


### 2. The main advantage of oop is that OOP provides a clear structure for the program, and keep it dry (don't repeat yourself " , and makes the codes easier to maintain, modify and debug. 
***
### 3. What is the structure of object-oriented programming?
### The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:
* #### Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.
* #### Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity. When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.
* #### Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.
* #### Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.

### What are the 4 main principles of OOP: Data abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism


*** 
### Relationship between a class and objects: class is the Blueprint or template of objects and objects are instances . Example of class  Car has objects of types (make)of cars (Volvo, Audi, Toyota, Tesla) and their attributes or fields ( color, make, model, year ,weight) and methods (or functions: drive and brake.

####  constructor: a class is like objects constructor, or a blueprint to create objects.
#### a special method is called a constructor that is used to initialize objects. For example model=" Santa Fe" in a method is called a constructor that sets initial value for a field. 
#### Static and public are two access identifiers .

#### Methods need to be public for objects to access. Static method can be accessed without creating an object of the class. 

#### Creating an object needs to specify the class name followed by the object name, and used the keyword new: Car toyota= new Car ();
